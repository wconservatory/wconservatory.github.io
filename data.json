These coaching sessions will allow each sectional group to work in isolation, enabling them to sort out the repertoire’s technical challenges and thereafter cultivate a unified sectional sound and interpretation.

			"place_description": "Located in Midtown Manhattan, Carnegie Hall is, without question, the most famous performance venue in the United States, if not the world. Constructed in 1891, the legendary concert hall has been home to hundreds of musical debuts – of composers’ newest works and of young soloists who would later become internationally renowned stars. Students will make their own debut on the Ronald O. Perelman Stage in the 2800-seat Isaac Stern Auditorium, thereby taking their own place in this fine tradition."
